Code Refactoring

## Contributors

Carl Bergquist

## Project Desciption

In this project we were required to take existing code and refactor it into semantic and logical order.
Along with that add alts to our img atributes without changing the over all funtionality and look of the website.
This was done to best optimize the website as a whole.
